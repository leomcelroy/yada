### Yet Another Dataflow Attempt
 
# TODO

- create evaluation model
  - should I support cycles
  - how is evaluation triggered
    - on wiring?
    - on run
    - on trigger event for nodes
- add view property to nodes
  - should I support arbitrary interfaces?
- add input fields
- add type system
- node bundling
- search by type inputs
- save/upload
- support asynchronous node evaluation
  - web workers in nodes
- custom script writing
- [x] add selection box
- [x] add drag and drop from toolbox
- [x] implement search
- [x] add node select
- [x] add multiple node selection/dragging
- [x] delete nodes
- [x] fix wire rendering
  - could implement with panZoom on svg as well, probably would be preferable
